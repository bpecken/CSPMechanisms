# CSPMechanisms

<i>Drosophila pseudoobscura</i> females that co-occur with sister species <i>D. persimilis</i> show elevated fertilization by conspecific sperm when they mate with both a heterospecific and a conspecific male. This phenomenon, known as conspecific sperm precedence (CSP), has evolved as a mechanism to avoid maladaptive hybridization with <i>D. persimilis</i>. In this study, we assessed pericopulatory (during mating) and postcopulatory (after mating) traits in crosses with sympatric or allopatric <i>D. pseudoobscura</i> females and conspecific or heterospecific males to evaluate potential mechanisms of CSP in this system.

## Data

Our data are composed of 3 data files. 'CSP_mechanisms_data.csv' contains our focal sperm viability dataset, including both 30 min exposure and 2 hr exposure data. 'Aftermating_2hr.csv' and 'testes_2hr.csv' contain our additional control data, where sperm was dissected immediately after mating or from the testes, respectively. See 'metadata.xlsx' for the metadata of each file.

## Scripts

Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.2. Code for all figures and statistical analyses are included in 'CSP_mechanisms_analysis.R' in chronological order by figure.
